1. Variables: I have used them for the themes color of project and font style. Like, for example primary-color and siliguri-font in _config.scss file.

2. Custom properties: I have used custom properties in few of the .scss files. Like, for example the custom property --primary-color is defined in the :root selector and is used to set the color of the links in the footer

3. Nesting: I have used Nesting in few of the .scss files. Like, for example the .navbar__top element is a child of the .navbar element, so it is nested within the .navbar selector.

4. Interpolation: I used interpolation to include the variable '$color' in the color property of '.desc' in the "_container.scss" file.

5. Mixin function: I have used Mixin in few of the .scss files. Like, for example, in the '_mixin.scss' file, I have used 3 mixin funtions to define transition, fex and desktop media query.

6. Placeholder Selectors: I have added the ::placeholder pseudo-element to style the placeholder text of the input and textarea elements with a light gray color (#a9a9a9).

7. Functions: I have used functions in few of the .scss files. Like, for example, I created a function "set-text-color' in the '_config.scss'.
